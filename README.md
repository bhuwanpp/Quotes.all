# Quotes.all

"Quotes.all" is a web application that allows users to create their own custom quotes and fetch quotes from an external API..

# Why

Need to save only Quotes with my own quote website not in google docs.

- If I need a Motivation I would find the quote.

* If I saw some quote or made it of my own I can save it
